# WareHouseSystem_WPF_MVVM

Current project is a WPF project for me to pratice. And currently it's not been complete.

I choose the MVVM pattern when i developed this project , and because of the time i have is limited , so part of the code didn't follow the rules of MVVM pattern. I will fix that later.

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Dev Environment: </b>
        Visual Studio 2017
    </li>
    <li> 
        <b>Database :</b>
        SQL Server Compact 4.0
    </li>
</ul>
